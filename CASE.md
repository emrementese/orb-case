# Event Reminder API Challenge

## Overview
Develop a RESTful backend service using Django and Django REST Framework that allows users to create, manage, and be reminded of upcoming events. This service will test your skills in API development, CRUD operations, and your ability to innovate and think about user needs.

## Features

### Event Management
Enable users to **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** event reminders. Each event should include attributes such as a title, description, date, time, and category.

### Reminder Notifications Simulation
Simulate notification features by providing an endpoint that lists upcoming events within a specified timeframe (e.g., the next 24 hours).

### Categorization
Allow events to be categorized (e.g., Work, Personal, Health) and provide an endpoint to retrieve events by their category.

## RESTful API Endpoints

- `POST /events` - Create a new event reminder.
- `GET /events` - Retrieve all events.
- `GET /events/{id}` - Retrieve details of a specific event.
- `PUT /events/{id}` - Update a specific event.
- `DELETE /events/{id}` - Delete a specific event.
- `GET /events/upcoming` - Retrieve events happening in the next 24 hours.
- `GET /events/category/{categoryName}` - Retrieve events by category.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**: The API must support all listed operations and correctly manage event data.
- **Creativity and Thoughtfulness**: Extra points for creative features like personalized reminder timings, contextual reminders, or any innovative feature that enhances the user experience.
- **Code Quality**: Your code should follow best practices in Python and Django development, being clean, readable, and maintainable.
- **API Design**: Your API should adhere to REST principles with clear and consistent naming conventions. Documentation or comments explaining how to use each endpoint are essential.

## Submission Instructions

Please submit your project through a GitHub repository link. Your `README.md` should include:

- **Setup and Installation Instructions**: Guide on how to get your project running.
- **API Endpoint Documentation**: Detailed descriptions of each endpoint, including methods, URL patterns, request payloads, and expected response formats.
- **Sample Queries**: Provide sample queries for each endpoint to demonstrate how to interact with your API for testing purposes.



Remember, the key to this challenge is not just in fulfilling the technical requirements but in demonstrating creativity and thoughtfulness in your approach to solving user needs.
